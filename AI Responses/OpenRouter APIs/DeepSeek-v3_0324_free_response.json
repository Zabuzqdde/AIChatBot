There is no single, universally accepted answer, but here are some common perspectives:\n\n### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n   - **Existentialism**: Life has no inherent meaning, and it's up to each individual to create their own purpose through choices and actions (e.g., Sartre, Camus).  \n   - **Absurdism**: Life may lack inherent meaning, but we can embrace its absurdity and find joy in the struggle (Albert Camus).  \n   - **Stoicism**: Meaning comes from living virtuously, accepting what we cannot change, and focusing on personal growth.  \n\n### 2. **Spiritual/Religious Views**  \n   - Many religions propose that life's purpose is tied to divine will—such as serving God (Christianity, Islam), attaining enlightenment (Buddhism), or living in harmony with the universe (Hinduism).  \n   - Some spiritual beliefs emphasize love, compassion, and connection as central to life's meaning.  \n\n### 3. **Scientific Perspective**  \n   - From a biological standpoint, life’s \"purpose\" could be seen as survival, reproduction, and the continuation of the species.  \n   - Cosmic perspectives (e.g., Carl Sagan) suggest meaning arises from our connection to the universe and the pursuit of knowledge.  \n\n### 4. **Personal Fulfillment**  \n   - Many find meaning in relationships, creativity, helping others, personal growth, or leaving a legacy.  \n   - Happiness, love, and the pursuit of passions often frame individual interpretations of purpose.  \n\n### 5. **No Meaning, and That’s Okay**  \n   - Some argue life doesn’t need an overarching meaning—it’s simply an experience to be lived fully.  \n\nUltimately, **the meaning of life is what you choose it to be**. It might evolve over time, shaped by your experiences, values, and beliefs.  \n\nWhat resonates most with *you*?","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":432,"total_tokens":444,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
